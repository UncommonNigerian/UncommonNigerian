- 👋 Hi, I’m Goriola. I love playing chess (a lot!) and scrabble. 
- 🎹 I also make LoFi Hip-Hop and Downtempo music. Check me out on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/60RIIDyCJ51CwBjyav7esq?si=o4OipZGiSVGe_M9_ssTa4w
- 👀 I'm switching careers from Oil & Gas Engineering to Data Science, so you can call me an aspiring (for now 😁) Data Scientist.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL and Data Analysis/Machine Learning with Python.
- 📊 I hope you'll enjoy my analytics and machine learning skills which I'll be displaying in my projects here on github.
